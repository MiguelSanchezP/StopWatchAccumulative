# StopWatchAccumulative
StopWatch that monitorizes the time and stores it to restart it in a future
This stopwatch works using the library chronos and the fstream, so it stores the data on a text file, then it uses an algorithm that passes the entry to an integer, and it continues with the counting
It is also a very easy code to upgrade
